The majority of meetings sucks, the majority of people don't want to be in
meetings, and the majority of meetings are useless, often without any actionable
items to do afterwards. Meetings cause context switching which tire the brain
and consume mental resources necessary to deliver work.

Nevertheless, meetings are important as a means of alignment and planning. Below
are my 5 rules to help you facilitate more productive, awesome meetings.

## The 10 Minute Rule

Research consistently shows that the human brain is not capable of
concentrating for longer than 20 minutes. TED talks never last longer than 18
minutes, and the late Steve Jobs in his keynote presentations always pivoted
every 10 minutes (either with demos, videos, or even introducing a new speaker).
Equally, when facilitating a meeting. Endeavour always to break facilitation in
10 minute blocks, the best way to do this is to ask the attendees if they have
any questions, ask for feedback, or comments; or even make space for another
facilitator. Use these opportunities to drive further discussion and debate.

## Favour the Problem over the Agenda Rule

Meetings without agendas are bad, meetings with agendas are better, but meetings
that are focussed on solving a problem are the best, even if those meetings
diverge from the said agenda.

A continuous nudge towards solving the problem at hand should always be favoured
over a previously set agenda. The best meeting facilitators are those who can
understand that a conversation or debate within a meeting has surpassed the need
for an agenda and let the conversation flow into attempting to solve the problem
at hand.

## The Convergence Rule

Meetings are not work, generally people don't want to be at meetings as they
lift them out of the work they're supposed to be doing. When discussing or
brainstorming ideas during meetings, ensure that there is *some* level of
convergent thinking occurring. This convergence doesn't necessarily
need to be concrete actionable items, but at least some level of decision to
move forward with the problem being solved.

## Dynamic Over Static Content Rule

Never use slides, never. In fact, delete keynote or PowerPoint decks from any
meeting facilitation that you may have. They are boring and condescending.
A meeting facilitator isn't a lecturer and slides lend themselves to trying to
deliver as much boring (often useless) information as possible. The human brain
can't process and store every bullet point written on a slide.

Favour collaboration tools like Mural or Jamboard as well as 'techniques'
to facilitate ideas and meetings like story mapping or impact mapping.

## The Silence Rule

Do not ever be afraid of silence in meetings. Silence is a powerful force that
allows very smart, interior thinkers within your team to form their ideas in
a succinct way. When a meeting facilitator does not have silent pauses in their
meetings, they are doing themselves and their team a disservice by not giving
these interior members the space necessary to form and express their ideas. I
have expressed my opinion, in more detail on this topic in my [previous blog post](https://blog.raph.ws/2022/02/acquiring-the-taste-of-silence/).

## Conclusion

Finally, meeting facilitation, like any skill, often requires hours of good
practice and feedback. When facilitating meetings attempt to gather feedback on
yourself regularly, be aware of your weaknesses, and continue to practice. Watch
over the meetings that have been recorded and look out for filler words and
nervous ticks that you may have.

I believe using the above 5 rules and practice will make you a better
meeting facilitator and presenter overall. All the best!
