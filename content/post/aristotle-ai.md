Aristotle defined reason as an attributes of humans that distinguishes them from
the animals.

> Man is the only animal who has reason.

> The soul never thinks without a picture.

He also defines rationality as the ability to understand the "abstract concepts"
by stating that all men "desire to know" by using their senses to go through a
process of "bringing to light" truths that may not have been revealed
previously. This "brining to light" (as he calls it) is fundamental in what
distiguishes humans from the animals. The analogy is telling, as Aristotle doesn't
suggest the thing which is being revealed by the light doesn't exist. Rather, it
just has not been revealed or discovered yet within the yet specific bounds of
knowledge or concepts currently available within time and space.

Aristotle does not mention intelligence directly, but his definition of
rationality includes the ability to be creative. This aligns with contemporary
experts' (such as Robert Sternberg, Howard Gardner, and James Kauffman) elements
of intelligence. ChatGPT itself designated creativity as an important element of
intelligence. See the answer below:
