One of the most influential philosophers to have ever existed is Aristotle. He
in turn influenced a multitude of influential thinkers that came after him.
Including the intellectual giants: [St
Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo),
[Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides), [Ibn Rasheed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes), [St
Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas), [Rene
Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), and [Friedrich
Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) (a few amongst many
others).

To say that Aristotle is an authority on philosophy, would constitute a fair
assumption; and one of the main actions that allows someone to "philosophise" is the
use of "reason". Aristotle defined reason as an attribute of humans that distinguishes them
from
the animals.

> Man is the only animal who has reason.

> The soul never thinks without a picture.

He also defines rationality as the ability to understand the "abstract concepts"
by stating that all men "desire to know" by using their senses to go through a
process of "bringing to light" truths that may not have been revealed
previously. This "brining to light" (as he calls it) is fundamental in what
distinguishes humans from the animals. The analogy is telling, as Aristotle doesn't
suggest the thing which is being revealed by the light doesn't exist. Rather, it
just has not been revealed or discovered yet, within the specific bounds of
knowledge or concepts currently available within time and space.


Aristotle does not mention intelligence directly, but his definition of
rationality includes the ability to be creative. This aligns with contemporary
experts' (such as Robert Sternberg, Howard Gardner, and James Kauffman) elements
of intelligence. ChatGPT itself designates creativity as an important element of
intelligence. See the answer below:

![Raph: Define intelligence
ChatGPT: Intelligence can be defined as the ability to learn, understand, reason, adapt, and solve problems effectively. It involves the capacity for abstract thinking, creativity, perception, communication, and logical reasoning. Intelligence is a complex trait that can manifest in various forms, including linguistic, spatial, mathematical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligence. It is not just limited to academic or cognitive abilities but also includes emotional intelligence and practical intelligence, which are essential for social and practical success. Overall, intelligence is a multidimensional construct that encompasses various cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of human functioning.](/images/chat-gpt-intelligence.png)

ChatGPT defines itself as "intelligent" but is this entirely accurate
considering the insights inferred above? That is: if an important aspect of
intelligence is creativity, can something not creative be intelligent?

ChatGPT by it's own definition concedes that it is not creative as it generates
"outputs" that can "be perceived as creative" based on the data and patterns
that it was trained with. Please see my dialogue with it below.

![Raph: Do you think you are creative?
ChatGPT: As an artificial intelligence language model, I don't have subjective experiences like humans do, so I don't have a sense of creativity in the way humans understand it. However, I was designed to generate new and unique outputs based on the patterns and data I was trained on, which some people might describe as a form of creativity. While I don't possess human-like creativity, I can assist humans in generating creative ideas, solving problems in novel ways, and coming up with original insights by analyzing and processing vast amounts of data and information.](/images/chat-gpt-perception-creative.png)

For full disclosure; ChatGPT is a very well built model and a very impressive
piece of technology overall, but like many things technology-related, the hype
around it can cause emotive  responses (some even of armageddon). It is
important to recognise that at this stage, the model itself is not intelligent
in the way intelligence has been defined by contemporary experts or ancient
philosophers. If ChatGPT does give an output that does seem to be "creative" by
inferring new ideas or insights, it has only been able to do this, as it has been
previously trained with data which has already had these inferences deduced from them.
That is: the information has previously been "brought to light".

One key aspect in deducing new knowledge is the ability to infer information
from data that has not been related previously. Whether models and deep neural
networks get to a stage where trained patterns are able to be used to infer
"new" information is something only time will tell.

A final thought ot consider is Aristotle's "desire to know" within the context of the dichotomy of
knowledge as defined by another ancient - Socrates:

> The more I know, the more I realise I know nothing.

This knowing of the unknown is a feeling that, up until now, only humans can
realise. Here, the human condition for something deeper is the desire for the light
that reveals truth (as Aristotle says). It seems to me, that we desire this light *because* of our imperfections, dichotomies, and
imperfect storage of incomplete data-sets.
