When I look at a healthy backlog, I feel that I'm going to achieve something, there's often a sense of security within the team, and a healthy backlog generally means there's little unplanned work being thrown towards the team. Feelings are important to the team and its members, and a healthy backlog can help with mood and emotions. In this post, I want to explain to you specifics of what I think a healthy backlog is.

## Transparent
The backlog has to be transparent. If only a small subset of team members or the Product Owner understand items on the backlog then it is not transparent. For a backlog to be transparent there needs to be a broad understanding within the team of items for the next few sprints.

## Refined
A refined backlog ensures steady flow of work and reasonably sized backlog items. These two attributes aid in transparency as explained below:

### Steady flow of work
The backlog needs to have enough refined items for 2 or 3 sprints so that the delivery team has enough work. More importantly though it's so that there's enough slack and freedom for the Product Owner to order the Backlog to maximise value for the next few sprints. If there's only enough items for 1 sprint coming up, then the Product Owner really doesn't have any freedom or choice to change the order of the Backlog if something changes (for example: risk)  

### Size
If items are too large to be delivered within a sprint or if items are too large to be sized then this should be a signal that items are not refined and can't be worked against. "Size" doesn't necessarily mean that items have to be estimated in Fibonacci points, it means that the items have to be deliverable within a sprint. An inability to size means that user stories need to be split up.

Actual numerical sizes may not be that valuable, however, the value in sizing isn't necessarily the size itself, but the act of sizing. The act of sizing uncovers unknowns and can normalise understanding through team discussion and debate. I've written about this in more detail [here] (/2018/02/3-2-1---reveal-points.-the-true-value-of-poker-sizing/). When there is healthy discussion and debate, there are often situations where estimates can't be given because user stories need clarification. This is an example where sizing can be valuable. For these reasons, I've often favoured T-Shirt sizing because if done properly, it can produce a common understanding amongst team members but not demand unnecessary attention to specific estimates.

## Organised
A healthy backlog has to be organised in a simple way, so that it can be consumed easily by team members.

### Hierarchical
Organising the backlog into a hierarchy of epics, features, and stories is a common pattern for healthy backlogs. The granualirity of the heirarchy changes from one project to the next generally depending on how value streams are split. If you do choose to organise your backlog heirarchically, I would recommend never leaving user stories without parents or in a generic parent in the backlog. I want to emphasise, if you have an epic or feature which is the first option when a user story becomes hard to categorise, I would suggest a re-examination of the hierarchy. We don't want a "too hard bucket for user stories".

### Ordered
A backlog needs to be ordered to maximise value out of the development team. This is often correlated to business priority, but as my colleague [Richard](https://www.richard-banks.org/) says "there are two priorities: 'very high' and 'very very high'. In some places there is 'very very very high'".

So how is it that we need to coach our Product Owners to order a backlog to minimise risk and maximise learning? We train our Product Owners to order according to two dimensions. Risk and value. We do the high risk high value items first, so that we know if there are any issues that may jeopardise the project, followed by the low risk high value items, followed by the low risk low value items. We advise our Product Owners to never actually tell the team to deliver high risk low value items as it doesn't make much sense to take high risk for something that will deliver very little value. 

## Consistent
Ideally, there should be consistency in the backlog. There are many ways to write acceptance criteria but let's keep it consistent. Likewise, there are many ways to name personas but it's important to keep them consistent. The value in consistency is that it reduces noise in the backlog and streamlines the thinking of the person who is supposed to be looking at and reading the backlog. This behaviour may implicitly encourage the delivery team to look at the Backlog more often than if the backlog isn't consistent.

## Dynamic
Finally, a healthy Product Backlog has to be dynamic. A Product Owner isn't a Product Backlog Owner. A Product Owner has to trust the team so that any member is able to modify items in the backlog, however, it is the Product Owner's responsibility to order the backlog to maximise value from the team.

The Backlog has to also be open to change and this includes deleting items - en mass! If it is found that the Backlog has many items which are high risk low value, not transparent, not understandable by most people. Then we should not be afraid of deleting these items.
