## The Experiment

To have a night out with a group of friends without the use of phones.
This means leaving phones at home, traveling to the destination, socialising,
and travelling back. I learnt many things during this experiement and I was
surprised how fun the night was, there were many things that I can't really
explain in words but here are some reflections that I am able to convey in
writing.

## Timing

The first thing that was apparent was that my friends and I needed to ensure
we got to the destination on time. When I have my phone with me, I'm usually a
bit more relaxed when arriving at a venue because if I'm late, I can easily
message everyone telling them that I'm running late. This time though, it was
different as I didn't have my phone, nor could I use my phone's GPS. I arrived
at the destination 10 minutes before the scheduled time and as soon as I got
out of my car I heard someone call out "Raph!". One of my other friends had
arrived there before me! We waited a few minutes then went into the venue for
some Italian pasta and pizza!

## Conversation transitions

Amongst most of my friendship circles, there's a social contract where the
_excess_ use of phones is considered rude. On this night, we didn't even have
our phones with us. I'm usually disciplined enough to avoid my phone during a
conversation, however, a dinner often involves a series of conversations. When
I have my phone, I often escape to it if a conversation topic doesn't interest
me and zone back in when it does. This time though, because I didn't have my
phone with me, I noticed the transition between conversation topics a lot more.

## Silences

There were a few silences during the conversation. These weren't considered
'awkward' silences, but rather moments to reflect. I felt that silences during
conversation weren't something to be frowned upon, but a positive indication
that a new level of depth was reached during the conversation. If I'd had a
phone with me, I probably would've escaped to it during these silences, instead
of recognising that people are reflecting and thinking with me.

## Conclussion

Phones are a necessity of life. At the most basic level, they're a mechanism
for our friends and family to contact us if they need help. Nevertheless, I
found socialising while disconnected from my phone to be a refreshing and
enjoyable experience. I'd recommend trying it if your circumstances allow!
