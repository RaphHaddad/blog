The new breed of digital marketers are here! They are called "Social Media Strategists". Social media strategy involves businesses generating social media actions (likes, tweets, checkins etc) on their own _business page_ (Facebook Fan page, Twitter account or Instagram account). The reason? to ensure that a _business page_ receives adequate attention on the news feed of _social media users_.  

  

These strategies include devising plans to post rich content that will enable loyal customers to perform _social media actions_ and hence provide a mechanism for customers to tell their friends about a certain company.

  

Now all this is well and good. But the customer loop is incomplete here, as loyalty is only being properly provided by the customer, not the business. For example: a certain customer may be liking a business' posts once a day, but he/she is not getting anything back. Until now...let me introduce - SIG.  

  

SIG (the Social Intelligence Grabber) is an engine that allows businesses to show their appreciation to customers who have performed _social media actions_ on their _business page_. It works by collecting social media actions, then rewarding customers according to these actions. Customers are then able to use these reward points for whatever the business wishes. 

  

SIG is able to be integrated into any loyalty platform and allows easy customisation of points. For example: a business may choose that a like is worth 2 points or 5 points; or that a share is worth 10 points or 20 points.
