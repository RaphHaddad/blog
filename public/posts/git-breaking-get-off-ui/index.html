    <p>Git is perhaps the best VCS I&rsquo;ve used in my life. However, some of the things I always hear when people are trying to learn Git, or have used it for a while but never in larger teams are:<br />
&ldquo;something stuffed up my Git&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;my Git is broken&rdquo;</p>

<p>In my experience, Git is probably the most predictable, deterministic tool I&rsquo;ve ever used (thankfully, considering it does version your code!).</p>

<p>About 9 times out of 10 the people saying things like the above are those who are relying on a GUI abstraction-tool of Git, whether they be GitExtentions, SourceTree, Visual Studio Team Explorer or others. Whilst I don&rsquo;t think these GUI abstractions are bad in and of themselves (in fact, I like using GitExtensions to visualise graphs and diffs). They don&rsquo;t allow you to understand the more intricate details of Git such as: branching, rebasing, cherry-picking, ref-logs, remotes, branch tracking, tagging, and squashing.</p>

<p>Going back to the breakages that are complained about above. These occur when: people pulling a main-line (master) branch into their feature branch, committing into the main-line (master) branch instead of a feature branch, or a bunch of merge conflicts because a sync hasn&rsquo;t been done for a while. These &lsquo;breakages&rsquo; more often than not can be avoided if there is a more intimate understanding of Git.</p>

<p>Using the command line allows you to have this more intimate understanding of Git as no commands are abstracted away. Two more advantages to the command line are: Having a history of the operations that have been made on your repository. So if something has broken, you can have a rough idea of where it broken. And secondly, wider community support and reach when you do need to do a web search and get help.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you find yourself struggling with your Git repository and fiddling too much. I suggest that you uninstall your GUI abstraction tool. Start using Git on the command line, then slowly introduce helper tools, if you don&rsquo;t know where to start simply try git &ndash;help. If I can learn the command-line. I&rsquo;m more than confident you can too! The Git documentation is really easy to read and often a git status on your repository tells you exactly what you need to do to achieve what you want.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading</p>
