    <p>Since time immemorial we humans have valued the art of public speaking. Today, I want to share with you my experiences in speaking at conferences for the first time. Recently, I spoke at both DDD Melbourne and DDD Perth. Both of which were positive experiences that I learnt a lot in.</p>

<p>So you may have been speaking at MeetUps, internal company events and/or Toastmasters and feel it&rsquo;s time to graduate to a full conference. Here are the things you have to take into consideration (based on my experience) when attempting to speak at a conference.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nDgFY3qq-Js/WcwvfCis5LI/AAAAAAAAOH0/FbHVH-z-P5Ew9Pl_cGE5VcZNhr_mGuaZgCLcBGAs/s1600/DJ0Ab4DVoAAk-wq%255B1%255D.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nDgFY3qq-Js/WcwvfCis5LI/AAAAAAAAOH0/FbHVH-z-P5Ew9Pl_cGE5VcZNhr_mGuaZgCLcBGAs/s320/DJ0Ab4DVoAAk-wq%255B1%255D.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Be prepared to have the talk that you least expect picked<br />
I had submitted a few talks about newer technologies and big data. However, none of these had been chosen. Instead, I had a talk about automated testing chosen, a talk about best practice and something that experienced developers have probably heard before but probably wish to hear again. <strong>That&rsquo;s OK, if you&rsquo;re talk was voted in or selected by a panel, it probably means people want to see you succeed and are interested in what you have to say.</strong><br />
Practice, Practice, Practice!<br />
I can&rsquo;t emphasis this enough. You may have gotten good at giving 15-20 minute talks at MeetUps and user groups, but a 45 minute talk is a lot more difficult. Your mouth will get dry, you may loose your chain of thought easier and <strong>it&rsquo;s physically more demanding</strong>. I hadn&rsquo;t practiced a lot prior to my DDD Melbourne talk and I think it was obvious to the audience. I did a bit more practice at DDD Perth and I think I did a lot better.</p>

<p>Live coding<br />
Some feedback I received from Perth was to simplify live coding. Don&rsquo;t write a whole program (no matter how simple you may think it is) and expect other people to follow. Only demonstrate one or two methods so that people can follow what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Have fun and relax<br />
Finally, you&rsquo;re there to have fun and relax. People don&rsquo;t want to see you fail, if they&rsquo;re at your talk it means they&rsquo;re interested in what you have to say anyway. Make a few jokes here and there and finally, ask for feedback on how you can improve for next time!</p>

<p>I hope the above has helped you all and I wish to encourage you all to give public speaking a chance!</p>

<p>Thanks you as always for reading.</p>
