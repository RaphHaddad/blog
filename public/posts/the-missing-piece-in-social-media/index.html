    <p>The new breed of digital marketers are here! They are called &ldquo;Social Media Strategists&rdquo;. Social media strategy involves businesses generating social media actions (likes, tweets, checkins etc) on their own <em>business page</em> (Facebook Fan page, Twitter account or Instagram account). The reason? to ensure that a <em>business page</em> receives adequate attention on the news feed of <em>social media users</em>.</p>

<p>These strategies include devising plans to post rich content that will enable loyal customers to perform <em>social media actions</em> and hence provide a mechanism for customers to tell their friends about a certain company.</p>

<p>Now all this is well and good. But the customer loop is incomplete here, as loyalty is only being properly provided by the customer, not the business. For example: a certain customer may be liking a business&rsquo; posts once a day, but he/she is not getting anything back. Until now&hellip;let me introduce - SIG.</p>

<p>SIG (the Social Intelligence Grabber) is an engine that allows businesses to show their appreciation to customers who have performed <em>social media actions</em> on their <em>business page</em>. It works by collecting social media actions, then rewarding customers according to these actions. Customers are then able to use these reward points for whatever the business wishes. </p>

<p>SIG is able to be integrated into any loyalty platform and allows easy customisation of points. For example: a business may choose that a like is worth 2 points or 5 points; or that a share is worth 10 points or 20 points. </p>

<p>This awesome product is available from CSB Engage, for more information about it, please visit the <a href="http://csbengage.com/products/sig">CSB Engage</a> website.</p>

<p>As one of the lead programmers on this project, I can tell you now that what we have done here is a product that is never seen before on the market. It is bleeding edge that will allow you to turn your social media strategy into loyalty!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
