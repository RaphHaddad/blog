<p>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re all here, let&rsquo;s just have stand-up now&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;so-and-so isn&rsquo;t coming today, so let&rsquo;s have stand-up now&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;ll just come over there and we&rsquo;ll do stand-up there&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems so easy and innocent to simply change the time and place of stand-ups, especially when key people such as the PO or Scrum master may not be attending the meeting for the day. The reasons I recommend for not changing are:</p>

<h3 id="habit">Habit</h3>

<p>The need for good habits is possibly the most obvious reason for not changing the time and place of your daily stand-up. If the daily stand-up becomes a habit it will be ingrained into the psyche of your team and the operation of the stand-up becomes something that individual team members provide, rather than an action that is demanded of them. By making stand-up a habit, you have left them with extra creative juices to use in more mentally demanding tasks, like design or architecture.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Steve Jobs used to wear the same clothes everyday, it&rsquo;s because it was a habit he had developed. He did not need to use will power or creative juices to make a decision on what to wear, meaning he used these mental resources later on in the day for more important things.</p>

<p>Rings alarm bells for more ingrained problems</p>

<p>The daily stand-up should not be a status update for any particular individual, but this may become the case if its timing is continually changed due to an individual’s absence. Instead of a status update, the daily stand-up should be an opportunity for the team to re-gather and plan their day in order to achieve a previously committed goal.</p>

<h3 id="team-building">Team building</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to say about a team who consistently – day in and day out – has a stand-up. If the habit of a daily stand-up develops within a team, it has done so because the team itself has found the stand-up rewarding. If the stand-up is rewarding, it means the team is delivering. In addition, a simple &lsquo;good morning&rsquo;, &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo; or &lsquo;how was your weekend&rsquo; from just one person in the team can strengthen an individual&rsquo;s morale who may be having a hard time at home, or that just has many things on his or her mind. An individual who knows that he or she  will be greeted politely at a set time, would probably sub-consciously be prepared for the kind words received at such a meeting.</p>
