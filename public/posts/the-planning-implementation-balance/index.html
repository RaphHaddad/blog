    <p>One of the great things about Agile is the ability to manage the expectations of stakeholders quite early in the development cycle. Likewise, from a business perspective: one of the great things about Agile is the ability to change requirements late in the development cycle.</p>

<p>When putting together an initial product backlog with estimates and detail. A certain amount of planning is done (whether this software product be a green field project or a slice in an existing project).</p>

<p>Recently I have found myself in several situations:</p>

<p>1. A situation where little planning had occurred and extremely poor estimates.<br />
2. A situation where far more planning had occurred and not so bad estimates.</p>

<p>Likewise, my trust of estimates in the second scenario was greater than the first. Either way, what&rsquo;s important is to manage this expectation with stakeholders and make things clear. Telling stakeholders or your PO with confidence why you don&rsquo;t have trust in your own estimates may seem like a silly thing to do. This transparency is needed though<strong> and if reasons are given as to why</strong>, then you have fulfilled your task in the initial product backlog building.</p>

<p>From my own experiences I see a clear equilibrium. If more planning is done, then estimates tend to not be so bad. If less planning is done, then estimates tend to be poor.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s hard to strike this equilibrium. Sometimes we are under business pressure, sometimes we are not allowed planning, sometimes we are allowed a lot of planning.</p>

<p>Usually when I don&rsquo;t have much time to plan, I not only have poor estimates but I don&rsquo;t even capture most of the work in the product backlog. As such, I find that the best equilibrium is when I have enough planning to <em>capture</em> most of the work in the backlog and not necessary have the most accurate estimates.</p>
