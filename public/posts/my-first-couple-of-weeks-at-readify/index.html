<p>So now I&rsquo;ve been at Readify for a few weeks and it has been great. If you gave me a few words to describe Readify I would say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Smart</li>
<li>Agile</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="consulting">Consulting</h3>

<p>There is a different dynamic working here for Readify as a consultant. As a consultant, one is not a employee of the business, but rather someone who provides a service. This change of mentality creates a different relationship all together between the developer and the product owner. Including things such as: more autonomy for the development team, a higher responsibility on the team lead and generally higher quality software. It creates a win-win situation for all. </p>

<h3 id="agile">Agile</h3>

<p>Readify development teams do Agile VERY well. Prior to starting with my first client, I was observing a team at the Readify office using a hybrid scrum-kanban methodology for their project management. I noticed instantly that all team members were aware of the workings of Agile. In addition to this, a CI pipeline was setup that linked to a build light. All these agile processes allowed members to get a feel to how well the team is progressing.</p>

<p>Many of these practices that I had tried to set up at my previous places of employment (and I was only slightly successful) had been fully implemented at Readify. What made me even more happy was the success that these processes were providing.</p>

<h3 id="constructive-feedback">Constructive Feedback</h3>

<p>Readify is a place where people aren&rsquo;t afraid to give and receive constructive feedback. In fact, the culture instilled into the Readify environment ensures that it is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that all other Readifarians are given the feedback they require for improvement.</p>

<h3 id="communication-skills">Communication Skills</h3>

<p>As a developer consultant at Readify, I am not only required to have excellent technical, engineering and development skills. But also, build my business, managerial and communication skills. I estimate about 70-90% of a Readifarian&rsquo;s life would be technical and the other would be these soft skills. Readify not only builds great developers but great entrepreneurs and thinkers in general. </p>

<h3 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h3>

<p>Perhaps the biggest reason why I joined Readify was because I will be able to learn from the smart people around me. I can say that after about 5 weeks that I have not been disappointed at this expectation. The mentoring that I have received in these last 5 weeks and the support from the other consultants has been invaluable. Readify has a ton of people who have been in the industry for 10-15 years (I mean IT has only been around for 20 years anyway), their wealth of knowledge has provided me so much insight.</p>

<p>Readify has been great so far, and I can see myself developing many skills here. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the great adventures, experiences and challenges that are to come!</p>
