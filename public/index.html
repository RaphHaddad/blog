            <p>When I look at a healthy backlog, I feel that I&rsquo;m going to achieve something, there&rsquo;s often a sense of security within the team, and a healthy backlog generally means there&rsquo;s little unplanned work being thrown towards the team. Feelings are important to the team and its members, and a healthy backlog can help with mood and emotions. In this post, I want to explain to you what I think the specifics are when I think of a healthy backlog, which, may help with mood but will certainly help with delivery.</p>

            <p>Pragmatism and quality are two things that are often pitted against each other when delivering software. When I think of pragmatism, I think what things can be avoided in order to deliver software to our customer sooner. When I think quality, I think a whole range of things including: maintainability, scalability, and interoperability of a system to name a few. It may also mean things that may not directly relate to the system for example: documentation, support, and user customisation.</p>

            <p>As alluded to in Part 1 and II it seems that DevOps has just become about CI/CD pipelines, provisioning infrastructure, and deploying applications. Today, we&rsquo;ll speak about CI/CD pipelines but more specifically the purpose they seek to provide.
Firstly, I think the term CI/CD is counter-intuitive. It&rsquo;s not a descriptive term and I would prefer to use the far more boring termÂ release pipeline because it is self descriptive. Our primary concern is how does candidate code get from a local developer&rsquo;s machine all the way into production.</p>

            <p>In the Part I we discussed how DevOps isn&rsquo;t about solving application problems using infrastructure but about being able to deploy to our targets in a sustainable way. We spoke about how increasing confidence enables personnel to release more often as risks are hedged by having solid application packages.

Today we will speak about how monitoring and observability can increase our confidence to enable us to release more often.</p>

            <p>In an ideal scenario a large organisation would have DevOps capabilities spread across their various teams. There would be no need to lean on an operations team to do any deployment, scaling, or observing of applications. Engineers would understand the inside and outside of infrastructure, security, logging, and message brokering.
The world isn&rsquo;t ideal though, that&rsquo;s not an excuse not to strive for the ideal.

            <p>For many organisations going through an agile or digital transformation, there seems to be a culture of standing around clapping. When this behaviour is regular and habitual for every little achievement, I become sceptical of its value.
Today, I would like to explain to you my scepticism.
Firstly, I think that many organisations that are going through a transformation stand in a circle and clap because they hadn&rsquo;t recognised achievements properly in the past.</p>

            <p>A few months ago I wrote a post I Donât Know. It was a post that explained why being honest about things you donât know is important, as it builds trust amongst team members. I also explained why saying you donât know something and following it up with a desire to actually take action, in order to gain that knowledge, is important. Today, I will talk about the words âit dependsâ.</p>

            <p>All too often people appeal to being &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; as a way to avoid following or having process. It could be because the term &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; implies flexibility or even because the Agile Manifesto itself says explicitly that &ldquo;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&rdquo;. Here, the manifesto doesn&rsquo;t say that being &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have process, it simply says you favour individuals over process. The demonisation of process could also be a knee jerk reaction of when teams had process imposed on them.</p>

            <p>Incremental, iterative, sprints. Whatever word you may use, the whole point is, as the agile manifesto says to Deliver working software frequently. The key here is working not necessarily perfect_.Â _Using the words just mentioned or even the word _agile_Â can cause some confusion. One of the most common aspects of confusion for people not wanting to deliver incrementally and pushing a large amount of changes into a future release is Aren&rsquo;t we agile, let&rsquo;s be flexible.</p>
