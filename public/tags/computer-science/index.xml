So I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in a situation where I have had to revise simple Data Structures from my Software Engineering Degree. I have not done this for several years, so naturally my first step in this process was looking at the workings of various structures on Google (then subsequently Wikipedia). After refreshing my memory, I decided that the best thing to do was code up these algorithm.
In this blog post, I will show you the BFS (breadth first search) and the DFS (depth first search) in Python.</description>
