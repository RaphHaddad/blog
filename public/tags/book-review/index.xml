      <description>Alex Ferguson was Manchester United FC&amp;rsquo;s manager for 27 years. During this time he managed the club to multiple titles while leading some of the most hard working, talented, and high performant players on the planet. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give this book a shot to see what I can get out of it in my everyday life. Whether you like Alex (Or Manchester United FC) or not. It is clear that Alex was successful in his tenure at United and Aberdeen.</description>

      <description>How We Got to Now is a book that I can&amp;rsquo;t really put into any individual genre. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a novel, isn&amp;rsquo;t a collection of small stories, isn&amp;rsquo;t purely educational, and isn&amp;rsquo;t historical. It is a combination of all of these genres and that&amp;rsquo;s what makes this book unique and enjoyable.
The book How We Got to Now describes, as suggested by its subtitle, &amp;ldquo;Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>For those of us wanting to improve our public speaking, have been speaking for a while, or just starting out. This is a great book which was lent to me by my colleague Paul. Below is my review which covers &amp;lsquo;how I read it&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;what were the main points&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;what was missing&amp;rsquo;.

Taken with my smart phone
For me, public speaking has always been about sharing knowledge. The difficulty is how do we share this knowledge in a way that is exciting, so that the audience is able to have the same interest in this knowledge that I am.</description>
