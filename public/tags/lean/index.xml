      <description>According to Wikipedia, commerce is the exchange of goods and services that existed as part of the human story since prehistoric times. Before currency we used to barter, then we began to use currency backed by resources like gold, and now we use fiat money (currency backed by the issuing government).
As humans we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt that this is the way we exchangeÂ value. When I go to a particular coffee shop on a Saturday it&amp;rsquo;s because I judge that the value in the coffee given to me is better than the shop next door.</description>
