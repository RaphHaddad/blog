      <description>What a journey it has been!
Whether it be developing SIG using the Facebook and Instagram APIs or managing huge data sets (close to 1 billion). CSB Engage has been a wonderful place to work. It had flexibility and a great culture. The best thing would probably be the Monday lunches. This is where one person from the team would bring lunch from home and we would eat together. I&amp;rsquo;m proud that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen CSB Engage grow from Endless Rewards, to its merger with OnitMedia and I&amp;rsquo;ve been there every step of the way.</description>
