      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never liked it when people get referred to as resources. Especially when it&amp;rsquo;s thrown around in front of the people themselves. Chairs, tables, capital, and computing power. These are resources, not people.
Nevertheless, a change of language is a good place to start.
A danger exists in any organisation where people may be abstracted away from their leaders, in these scenarios, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see people as resources or see people as a composition of their attributes be they: technology strengths, experience, height, weight and/or salary band.</description>
